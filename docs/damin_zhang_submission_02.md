I contributed to several aspects of this project. I discussed with my teammembers and co-design the data model. I also help design the UI of our webpages.

In addition, I designed and implemented the view code, model code, init code as well as url deisgn and mapping.

Lastly, I redesign the html files and css to make the website look neat.
