Unfortunately, I didn't do as much for this project as I did the others. Thankfully, my teammates helped cover me. However, I didn't do nothing.
I helped implement parts of the login and logout process. Specifically, I added these features onto the base html file so that the user information is displayed whenever they are logged in.
Also, I helped look over the other parts of the code to see if they matched the criteria needed for this project. One thing that I found was that we did not allow the user enough room to modify existing data inside our database.
