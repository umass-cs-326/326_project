# Apoorva Karpurapu, CS 326 
# Team Knock Out

Based on my collaboration for this project, we as a group worked very well together and split up the work in an equivalent way. At first, we all made decisions towards the data model and had to see what would be ideal for the end result and how it would fit our website. I specifically had the tasks of working with Frick on working with views.py before implementing the urls, and working with mock data. Through the means of mock data, I was able to create mock genres, movies, request, etc in init.py.

This at first, was a challenge because I did not have much experience working with this before but, it was a roadway to improvement and learning new things. Through this improvement, I was able to grasp and help the team stay on track with the individual tasks we need to fulfill through the project as in reminding them to meet up, pull through tasks, and working through the process of the setting up the project. The set up involved a lot of instructional methods from the website provided.

Additionally, I spent the rest of my time also working through the project write-up and video with Kuhu. This was a learning adventure, as we were both learning some of this material for the first time. Through this we were both able to work through the video, and set up the django environment on my laptop. And, it was easy to articulate the problems/successes. At the end, with the collaboration and use of research of StackOverflow the project was an accomplishment.
