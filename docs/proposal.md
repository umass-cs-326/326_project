# Innovative Idea

UMass Amhest students often struggle to find certain products they need or sell them near or throughout the semester. To remedy this, our project, UMarket, aims to provide a platform for students to buy, sell, or exchange products with each other, without needing to travel far distances to any sketchy locations that websites like Craigslist may demand. Listings will be cleaner and more organized, and users will find it easier to navigate for specific items.

The product page is the individual page of a single item listing. Here, users are able to view a full description of an item as well as all information displayed on the browsing page. In addition, a button is listed that will help users express their interest in the product and will provide communication between the buyer and seller.
