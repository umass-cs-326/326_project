## Individual Writeup - Team Flick

Throughout the project, as similar to the last project. I helped with the data visualization portion, and wanted to make changes based on our results. We all worked together collaborating and brainstormed for what we needed vs. what we didn't need. I reasearched how to work with the permissions for the authentication portion, and helped a team member go through with this process. 

Then, I did the technical documentation throughout the project by keeping track of what the team has done for the writeup portion. I wrote about the overview, design implementation, and closely observed the problems and successes. Within this process, I was able to collaborate efficiently within the group and attend the group meetings by also delegating the work properly.

Towards the final result, Kuhu and I both worked together to formulate the entire video. We made a script, and ran the application on my laptop to ensure it was working. We closely walked through the process from authentication and then moving on to the forms to show the users the progresss we conducted. This was overall a collaborative and big learning experience as we didn't know anything about this before.
