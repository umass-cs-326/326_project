#Part 3: Team Write Up


Overview: A brief overview of your application. Please highlight any changes from your project proposal since the Project 1 submission.
Our team is creating an application where an individual can schedule a time, request a party of up to 5 people, and match with those people to watch a movie of their choice. It is called “Flick”. The whole idea of this application is so that no one has to watch a movie alone if they don’t want to, and can use this application to make friends around the UMass or Five College campuses. This application consists of 5 web pages, a homepage where all the movies are listed, a page where an individual can request to watch a specific movie at a certain time of their choice, a location of their preference, with people they want to watch it with.
