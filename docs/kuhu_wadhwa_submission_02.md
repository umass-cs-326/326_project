In this project 2 submission, I learned a lot in terms of the actual code and project but I also learned the importance of committing to our group to make our final product work. I attended every meet up except one which I was home for to go to the doctor's for my health condition. I sat with Frick to understand Django and helped check his code for the views.py page.
My biggest contribution was definitely the video and team write up. Apoorva and I sat down and wrote a script for the video to address all the work that was done and I worked on the team write up with her as well. I looked over the code and collaborated with most team members except the ones that weren't present at every meeting. 
In this project submission I had the opportunity to learn Django and understand how the data objects are connected to the actual Django administration page for where all the data would show up. This was the most interesting part that I learned. I definitely am excited for the User Authentification part of the next project since I made the request page for Flick and I will get to see it in action.
