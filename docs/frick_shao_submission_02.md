This project required a lot more time than we all thought, so I think we all did quite a lot and contributed a lot of our time.

I personally played a major part in writing the views and helped with the templates. I also looked over the other files like the models and urls and commented on things that I felt should be fixed or improved on.

Finally, I provided my opinions on how our data model should work and added parts which I thought would need to be inside the data model.
