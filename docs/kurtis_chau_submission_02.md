I mainly contributed to:

  admin page, setting up the admin page, and making sure we can import fake data and that would work with the actual app.
  
  url mappings
  
  views functions: making necessary changes so that each template would have access to the data.
  
  models: making nessacery changes so that the app would work correctly and each component have access to the data, including setting up url to external images, and setting up user id and movie id
  
I also worked on:

  making important changes so that the web app would work properly, including the init.py, url and pages and variable references in the html files.
  I also set up image hosting and user/movie's reference to their images.
