I 
1. implemented the custom form for signup
2. modified our orignal user class: renamed to Profile, set up 1-to-1 connection to a user
3. Implemented redirecting to profile page after log in
4. Implemented the view function for sign up, made sure it would create a new User as well as a new Profile.  Implemented changes so that they would align correction.
5. Implement profile edit functionality, set up correct permission
6. Made changes to admin.py, init.py, models, as well as views so that everything would work correctly
