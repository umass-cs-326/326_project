In this project submission, 
I contributed to the team by providing help on decision making in the authentication process of the code and overall 
stayed on top of the status of the team. I also reminded the team when to meet and looked over the code to see if the 
design looked okay and was what we ultimately wanted it to look like.
My biggest role in this project was the video submission. Apoorva and I worked on the video together and to make it work 
properly, we had to test and debug multiple issues by testing various usernames to make sure the site login page worked 
correctly. We wrote a script and edited the video. I learned the importance of testing before recording or showing a final 
product because if the product doesn't work well on the first go, it gives a bad impression and can mean that we didn't 
portray what is needed of us. We are ultimately proud of how this submission came out and I am excited for the next assignment.
